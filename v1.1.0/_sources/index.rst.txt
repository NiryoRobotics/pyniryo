This documentation presents Ned's PyPi package, which is a
TCP API made with Python.

It offers a simple way for developers to create programs for robot and
to control them via remote communication from their computers.
Contrary to the Python ROS Wrapper, the user will not need to be connected on the robot
through a terminal.

.. note:: This package is able to control Ned in simulation
   as well as the physical robot.
