Code templates
==============

As code structures are always the same, we wrote down few templates for you
to start your code file with a good form.

The short template
-------------------

Very simple, straightforward:

.. literalinclude:: code_snippets/short_template.py
   :linenos:


Advanced template
-------------------

This template let the user define his own process but it handles connection,
calibration, tool equipping, and makes the robot go to sleep at the end:

.. literalinclude:: code_snippets/advanced_template.py
   :linenos:

Advanced template for Conveyor Belt
--------------------------------------

Same as `Advanced template`_ but with a Conveyor Belt

.. literalinclude:: code_snippets/advanced_template_conveyor.py
   :linenos:

Advanced template for Vision
--------------------------------------

Huge template for Vision users!
